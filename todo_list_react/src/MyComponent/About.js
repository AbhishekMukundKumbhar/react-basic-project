            <h4>Step 1:</h4>
            <p>Write down all of the tasks that you need to complete. If they're large tasks, break out the first action step, and write this down with the larger task. Ideally, tasks or action steps should take no longer than 1-2 hours to complete.</p>

            <b>Note:</b>
            <p>You may find it easier to compile several lists covering personal, study, and workplace, for example. Try different approaches and use the best for your own situation.</p>

            <h4>Step 2:</h4>
            <p>Run through these tasks allocating priorities from A very important, or very urgent to F unimportant, or not at all urgent.</p>
